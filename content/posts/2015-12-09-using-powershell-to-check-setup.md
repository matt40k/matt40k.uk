So I was handed over some new servers, before I got started I wanted to check everything was as it was suppose to be, so I wrote a few PowerShell scripts to check each server was setup correctly. I wanted my DEV toÂ 100% match my UAT and so on.

First, I wanted to check who has local administrator access on the servers.

Next, I wanted to check the drives &#8211; I wanted to make sure each drive letter was the same across environments and all had a proper label.

Finally, I wanted to check the service accounts that my SQL services were running as, again, PowerShell to the rescue.
