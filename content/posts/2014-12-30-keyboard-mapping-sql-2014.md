I&#8217;ve been working on SQL Server 2014 lately and one of the annoying problems I&#8217;ve stumbled across using SSMS is that F5 no longer means execute the SQL query, it now means Debug. Which brings up an annoying popup (least for me) about configuring my Windows Firewall.

This can be changed in SSMS by going **Tools** > **Customize&#8230;** > **Keyboard&#8230;**

The default is:

`Debug.Start (F5 (Global))`

And the traditional is:

`View.Refresh`

You can also do it by setting it to Visual Studio 2010 Compatible
