I always find it funny when IT departments talk about BI for their company and they don&#8217;t actually have a BI solution in place for themselves. Surely you should practice what you preach?

So why do IT departments need BI. Well lets look at <a href="http://boinc.bakerlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rosetta@home</a>.

Doesn&#8217;t sound good does it. Almost like they&#8217;ve been hacked or suffering a DDOS.

> <span class="news_content"><b>Slowdown Update:</b> As it turns out, the slow-down experienced during the last week of July was the result of a very large surge in users joining the project through a new campaign by <a style="color: blue;" href="http://charityengine.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://charityengine.com</a>. As the servers were behaving properly &#8211; just overwhelmed &#8211; and DK was on a well-deserved holiday, it was difficult for the rest of us to pin-point the cause. You can see the recent surge <a style="color: blue;" href="http://boincstats.com/en/charts/14/project/perDay/user/total/chart.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br /> We are looking at changing/expanding our webserver frontend to be more resilient to surges like this in the future. Yet again, we apologize for the frustration </span>caused. -KEL

6 days later they twig. Using the third party stats site &#8211;<a href="http://boincstats.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BoincStats.com</a> they get a bit of <a href="http://boincstats.com/en/charts/14/project/perDay/user/total/chart.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">visual analysis</a>. They&#8217;ve seen massive new user growth. Having a cloud based solution is only half the solution, knowing when to scale up and when to scale down is the other half of the problem.
