Back in May (2014) I decided to start up a blog, again. I decided to keep it simple and just get a off the shelf hosting package rather then going to extremes like I normally do &#8211; configuring a VPS or even a Dedi server! I ended up going with <a href="http://www.csnewmedia.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CS New Media</a> &#8211; it was just their lite Linux package which I signed up for 3 months. I was tempted to stick with what I know and go with <a href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mythic-Beasts</a> like I normally but I like to tinker and try new things so I went with <a href="http://www.csnewmedia.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CS New Media</a> after a failed attempt to spend my dosh with <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NameCheap</a> &#8211; when it came to entering my card details, it just failed to connect to &#8220;their&#8221; backend and their response was, well it works for me, try another browser &#8211; by the time I phoned them I had already tried different browsers, internet connections, computers so at that point I just walked away.

Anyway fast forward two months and I was getting ichy to move away from <a href="http://www.csnewmedia.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CS New Media</a> &#8211; nothing wrong with them, a bit of downtime, but nothing major and it was all stupid-o-clock, performance was ok, nothing special and support &#8211; well I never used it so, can&#8217;t comment. Using <a href="http://sp.parallels.com/products/plesk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="broken_link">Plesk</a> was a blast from the past &#8211; that was the first web control panel I ever used, so it was nice to see how it&#8217;s improved.

Problem was, where do I go, well <a href="http://blog.mythic-beasts.com/2013/11/07/sphinx-aka-triggers-broom/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mythic-Beasts had fitted SSDs into their web servers</a> since I&#8217;ve hosted with them, tempting. Then <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DigitalOcean</a> did it. They announced a new data centre. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/introducing-our-london-region/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">In London</a>. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/announcing-ipv6-support-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">With IPv6</a>. And they have that sexy <a href="https://developers.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">API</a>. Ooo and I have credit with them for some reason or other, happy days. I decided to take it slow and script the whole process &#8211; I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="https://github.com/matt40k/DigitalOcean-PowerShell" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PowerShell </a>lately, so <a href="https://github.com/matt40k/DigitalOcean-PowerShell" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I created a PowerShell script </a>that <a href="https://github.com/matt40k/DigitalOcean-PowerShell" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">creates the DNS records</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matt40k/DigitalOcean-PowerShell" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">builds the droplet</a>. I&#8217;ve even managed to get it to convert the Putty public SSH key into OpenSSH format so <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DigitalOcean</a> will accept it and I can use SSH keys to connect to the server. I was planning on scripting the build process of installing the LEMP stack &#8211; but I lost interest to be honest and <a href="https://www.linode.com/stackscripts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">enough </a><a href="https://rtcamp.com/easyengine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">already exist</a>.

Net result, it&#8217;s got my <a href="https://github.com/matt40k/DigitalOcean-PowerShell" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PowerShell </a>knowledge up &#8211; all the codes in my <a href="https://github.com/matt40k" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GitHub repository</a>. One of the off-shot projects of the project was a PowerShell function to generate secure passwords, the idea was my <a href="https://github.com/matt40k/PowerShell-GenSecurePass" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DigitalOcean PowerShell</a> script would generate passwords for your newly created droplet &#8211; MySQL root password for example, store it as say CSV on your local machine and only pass the password as an argument to the stack install script over SSH &#8211; so it wouldn&#8217;t get stored on the remote server discs.
