This might sound pretty pointless and silly but when talking about a 20 working day SLA a day can mean alot between a massive fine or compliance.

During one of my <a href="https://directdrive.academy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">driving lessons</a> with <a href="https://directdrive.academy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gary</a> we were talking about his recent <a href="https://www.facebook.com/garygibbsADI/videos/1153963814665251/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">streak of passes</a>. The conversation then lead on to pass rates and us wondering how this broken down &#8211; for example, by gender, ethnicity, age, driving instructor type (intense driving school \ chain \ individual driving instructor \ family etc).

Still curious, I decided to send off an a FOI request, before doing so, I went looking to see if someone else has which lead me to find some rather shocking data (see the bottom of the post). For those who don&#8217;t know, FOI stands for Freedom of Information. This is where Joe Public can request (reasonable) information from the public sector &#8211; after all, it is your (tax) money that they are spending. Logging FOI is dead straightforward thanks to <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WhatDoTheyKnow</a>. Anyway, the Freedom of Information Act requires them (public sector folks) to reply within 20 working days.

First question. If I log a call on Sunday, what day is day one? So firstly, Sunday doesn&#8217;t count. It&#8217;s not a weekday. So Monday&#8217;s day 1? That&#8217;s what I would think, and it&#8217;s even what <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WhatDoTheyKnow</a> says, but the DVLA say its the Tuesday. After a few emails between them both, I went off an ask ICO, Information Commissioner’s Office who&#8217;s responsible for these things. Here is their response

> _counting the first working day **after **a valid request is received as the first day_

So, if you log a FOI over the weekend, they receive it on the Monday, that&#8217;s Day Zero. Day One is actually the second day.

They also say

> _Working day means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or public holidays and bank holidays; this may or may not be the same as the days they are open for business or staff are in work._

&nbsp;

So its important that public sector don&#8217;t close for extra days as they risk eating into that time they have to respond to FOI request and failure to reply can (ultimately) result in fines.

Going off topic &#8211; there are some determined people in Suffolk who really want to drive.
