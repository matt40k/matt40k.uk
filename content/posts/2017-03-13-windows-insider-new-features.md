Today&#8217;s Windows Insider email included a few new cool features, here are my Top 3

> **Do more at once with the new Compact Overlay window.** Keep watching a movie or video chat on one corner of your screen — even when switching apps to check email or browse the web. When an app window enters compact overlay mode, it&#8217;ll be shown above other windows so it won&#8217;t get blocked. Look for updates to the Movies & TV app and Skype Preview app to take advantage of this feature in the near future.

> **A smart way to lock your PC.** Dynamic Lock automatically locks your Windows 10 PC when you&#8217;re not around, based on the proximity of your Bluetooth-paired phone. If your Bluetooth-paired phone is not found near your PC, Windows turns off the screen and locks the PC after 30 seconds.

> **Public Preview of Windows Analytics: Update Compliance.** Update Compliance is a free service that provides you with a holistic view of Windows 10 update compliance for the devices in your organisation, including installation status for both monthly quality updates and new feature updates. <a href="https://click.email.microsoftemail.com/?qs=1f86bde3fb0c42e3707a16fadd7e7a4ff3d1ad8bfd57eeb2024de1a50d916595822aaee45d5529100488fcf08912a05e7697f02a0446ba7a" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&q=https://click.email.microsoftemail.com/?qs%3D1f86bde3fb0c42e3707a16fadd7e7a4ff3d1ad8bfd57eeb2024de1a50d916595822aaee45d5529100488fcf08912a05e7697f02a0446ba7a&source=gmail&ust=1489525850685000&usg=AFQjCNGQY20UBwL61vnbxrLDDU2GI7KRJg" rel="nofollow">Click here for details on how to set up the service for your organisation</a>.
