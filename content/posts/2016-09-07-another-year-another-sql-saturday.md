Unfortunately this year I&#8217;ve not been able to make any of the pre-cons, however the (free) community day looks epic &#8211; the hardest part is going to be selecting which session to attend, the final one looking the worst. Aghhh!!! I&#8217;m going to have to roll a dice or something!

One session that really peak my inter-geek, which had me looking at getting a Microsoft Band &#8211; only to find out they are running the stocks low at the moment (they release the first and second one in October, so it looks like the 3 will be out soon).

#### **The (Consumer) Internet of Things on your arm &#8211; MS Band & PowerBI connected**

<pre>The Internet of Things (IOT) gets more and more attraction - not only on the business but also on the customer side. Connected fridges, cars and smart watches - always and everywhere connected! In this session Wolfgang will show you some possibilities of the Microsoft Band 2 SDK: how-to connect and read sensor data out of this device. But what should be done with that data? 
Power BI seems to be an ideal candidate for analyzing and presenting those kind of data. The different types of real-time analytics (Stream Analytics, Power BI API, ..) will be presented and their pros and cons will be envisioned. 
The challenge: Let's prepare a real-time dashboard of Band2 data in Power BI in 60 minutes!</pre>

#### **Imagine If &#8211; Train the Trainer Micro:bit session**

<pre>Want to help inspire young people and deliver a Micro:bit workshop?

If you are a teacher, parent or anyone interested in inspiring the next generation of technical experts; then come along to the Micro:bit session to get you started on how you could deliver a micro:bit workshop for either Primary or Secondary school children to code and create. 

In this session you will be taken through a workshop setup and approach (introduction, 3 coding tasks and a quiz) as well as getting hands on with the BBC micro:bit
