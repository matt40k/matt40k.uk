I received NameCheap newsletter today full of annoying holes (at least for me), needless to say I hit the unsubscribe button shortly after.

<a href="//matt40k.uk/img/2014/06/namecheap1.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-124" src="//matt40k.uk/img/2014/06/namecheap1.png" alt="namecheap1" width="631" height="286" /></a>

First mistake &#8211; mark your calendars. Did they not check their calendar before sending it? The June 10 was 2 weeks ago!

$1, one dollar!! You&#8217;re trying to promote .UK, use the local currency, using £ (GBP)!

Final mistake I notice (I didn&#8217;t look very hard to be honest) was the &#8220;SCHOOLSOUT&#8221; code. Sorry, that&#8217;s not till next month. Perhaps someone should buy NameCheap a calendar.
