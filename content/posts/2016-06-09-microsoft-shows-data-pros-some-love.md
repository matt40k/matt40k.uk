Microsoft has released <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dataplatforminsider/2016/03/31/microsoft-sql-server-developer-edition-is-now-free/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SQL Server 2016 Developer, for free</a>. That&#8217;s right, zero, zip, nothing. Completely free. The developer edition is fully featured, it contains the same goodness as the $$$ Enterprise edition. The catch? Its not for production.
