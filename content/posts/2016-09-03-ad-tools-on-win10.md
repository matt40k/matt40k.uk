A while ago I got a new laptop at work with Windows 10 Enterprise and for a while I just kept using my old Windows 7 Enterprise laptop for bits I hadn&#8217;t yet transferred over. The last thing on the list was AD tools. This should just be a question of installing **<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=45520" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10 (KB2693643)</a>**. Unfortunately

> Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10 is available only in English (United States) for this release.

So we need to install **English (United States) language package**. We can do this by

  * **Start** > **Settings** > **Time & Language** > **Region & Language**
  * Click on **Add a language** and select **English (United States)**
  * Under **English (United States) **select &#8220;**Language pack available**&#8220;
  * Click on **Options**
  * Click the option to download and install the Language Pack
  * Restart Computer
