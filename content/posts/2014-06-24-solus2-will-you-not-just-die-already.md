Well it appears Capita has announced SOLUS2 death day

That&#8217;s assuming they don&#8217;t put it back. Again.

This is bad news. Let me explain why.

I&#8217;m using Chrome, it&#8217;s updated itself I don&#8217;t know how many times. If I go and check, all I know or care about is that it is indeed up-to-date, so at some point, it&#8217;s updated itself and its worked.

If I look at my antivirus I can see it&#8217;s updated 3 times today alone. Again, this is all in the background without me doing anything.

Now compare this with SIMS and SOLUS2. I wonder how many hours I&#8217;ve wasted supporting schools doing SOLUS2 upgrades in my past life. I dread to think.

Before you start waiving the MSI flag, let stop and have a look at the outstanding CR logged on SupportNet today (24/06/2014) for the past year. <a href="//matt40k.uk/img/2014/06/Capita-SIMS-Outstanding-CRs1.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Extract here</a>.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">1,057. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Wow. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I dread to think how many have gone unlogged or is older then a year!!</span>

Capita clearly can&#8217;t roll them up into a major build. How many re-releases have you seen? Add the fact it doesn&#8217;t even seem to be making a dent in CR mountain and you can see why Capita wants to be Agile like the <a href="http://www.bromcom.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">other</a> <a href="http://www.scholarpack.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MIS</a> <a href="http://www.arbor-education.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">suppliers</a>.

Not sure I fancy pushing out 1,057 updates&#8230; per school&#8230;
