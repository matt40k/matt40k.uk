If you ever need a lesson in the importance of picking a <a href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">good domain registrar</a>, then read about <a href="https://matt40k.uk/2014/12/4th-anniversary-of-contributing-to-rosettahome/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rosetta@Home</a> recent problems.

> Dear Rosetta@Home participants,

> We &#8212; like many of you who have contacted us &#8212; have been extremely
  
> frustrated by the long project downtime. We (<a href="http://bakerlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&q=http://bakerlab.org&source=gmail&ust=1489438011639000&usg=AFQjCNHfVoxrkMoQ_sGFNLegJ8_EIYYbEQ" rel="nofollow">bakerlab.org</a>) had a domain
  
> name registration verification lapse, and our registrar (<a href="http://dotster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&q=http://dotster.com&source=gmail&ust=1489438011639000&usg=AFQjCNGCp7gao7ww0AhkIsCTQuzkyF_g9A" rel="nofollow">dotster.com</a>)

We went through the steps to
  
> getting it verified again Monday afternoon. What should have been a
  
> quick procedure is now stretching into 4 days. We apologize for the mass
  
> emailing which we have tried to keep to a minimum throughout the course
  
> of the project, but this is an extraordinary situation and we have no
  
> other way of reaching all of you now.
> 
> Since being down we estimate that we have lost a total of around 3.1
  
> million computing hours and continue to lose around 540 computing hours
  
> per minute.
