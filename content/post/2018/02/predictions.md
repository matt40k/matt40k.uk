description: Few predictions for the near and distance future.
---
Here are a few of my predictions based on my experiences over the last few months.

First. [Azure Data Catalog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/data-catalog/) is going to be massive in the near future (18 months). The (hopefully) future integration with the new [SQL Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-data-discovery-and-classification) is going to help massively with GDPR.

Secondly, [Chris Webb](http://crossjoin.co.uk/) is going to become very popular. With [Azure Analysis Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/analysis-services/), the big question is optimize or scale. The killer feature for any monitoring tool aimed at the BI market is going to have to answer that question. This is before we even get onto the awesome idea he shared with me at [SQLBits](http://sqlbits.com/).

My final prediction is the downward spiral of [Nationwide](https://Nationwide.co.uk) over the next 15 years, with Nationwide becoming the new Blockbuster. It's very telling when you have to offer Â£200 to entice new customers.
