**Salamanders**

Back in September 2021 I started getting back into [Games Workshop](https://www.games-workshop.com)'s [Warhammer 40,000](https://warhammer40000.com) universe after a long stint of being out of the game due to other more important life commitment taken over. I started by collecting the hideous, insectoid xenos Tyranids which I decided to plan in the traditional [Genestealer](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Genestealer) colours of blue and purple. After a while and many thousands of points later, I grew bored of painting blue and purple.

I decided I wanted to try paint something different, I didn't want to create a whole new army. I had already commited (ie bought) to Adeptus Custodes. I remembered back in the day when [Games Workshop](https://www.games-workshop.com) created a [diorama of the entire Ultramarine chapter](https://www.chaosbunker.de/en/2020/06/03/a-trip-down-memory-lane-first-time-to-warhammer-world/?cn-reloaded=1) and the got each store to paint a tactical squad and a rhino. I thought, yes, I'm gonna paint JUST a tactical squad and a rhino in for my first love, Salamanders.
