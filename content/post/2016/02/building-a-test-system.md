So eariler this month I switched from my <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Azure</a> hosted <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TeamCity</a> server to <a href="https://www.appveyor.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Appveyor</a>, which freed up some much need <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Azure</a> credit. This month, it looks like its going to be going on a <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2015/01/08/azure-virtual-machine-images-for-visual-studio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Ultimate vm for some SharePoint development</a>. Hopefully this won&#8217;t take too long to do as I really want to get on with machine learning after a demo from <a href="https://twitter.com/ijanric" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ric Howe</a>.

I&#8217;m also looking at building a few test machines locally &#8211; old school I know! I found this article on <a title="Oxford SBS Guy" href="http://www.oxfordsbsguy.com/" rel="home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oxford SBS Guy</a> really useful for building the template image.
