Two new <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Azure</a> features have caught my eye &#8211; the first is <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/app-service/logic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Logic App</a>. In a nutshell this is workflow. You have connectors and you can add triggers and actions. So you could have a trigger on your HR system that when a new employee starts, it creates a user account then sends a welcome message to the existing staff informing them of the new starters.

The other is <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/data-catalog/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Data Catalog</a>, this basically allows you to generate meta data about your data sources. Effectively this becomes your documentation, your point of reference when it comes data. This looks to solve a very real problem large enterprises have. Too much data, silo away.
