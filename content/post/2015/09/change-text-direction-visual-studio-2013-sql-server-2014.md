I&#8217;ve spent a while today trying to change the text direction (orientation) of a header on a SSRS report &#8211; the option was rather oddly placed in Visual Studio &#8211; the option is within the properties (for the text) **Localization** > **Writing Mode** > then change from **Default** to either **Rotate270** or **Vertical**. I was hoping it would be within the Font options. Guess that would be too easy ðŸ˜‰
