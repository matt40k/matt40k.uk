So I&#8217;ve been following a few folks on Twitter &#8211; one of them is <a href="http://www.timmitchell.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tim Mitchell</a> from the US, he <a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Mitchell/status/638020785429479424" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tweeted a link to some resources</a> he used in a recent <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SQL Saturday</a> he presented at.

One of them is <a href="http://www.konesans.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Konesans.com</a>. Who happen to be based in Holbeach, which is really close to my home town of Wisbech. You go all over the world in search of knowledge, only to find there&#8217;s a guru right on your own doorstep.
